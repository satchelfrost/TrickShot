### Playable build 
Playable build only works for Windows. You can alternatively build from source.

Instructions for Downloading the playable build game:

1. Click on the game download link.
2. Once the link opens up a new tab, click the drop down menu of WindowsNoEditor and click download (it is important that you do it this way because you need to download ALL the files and folders, not just the .exe).
3. Just before it finishes, Chrome might ask you if you want to leave the page, go ahead and click leave, and then a zip should start downloading.
4. Once it has finished downloading, put the zip wherever you please on your computer and then right click on the zip and then click extract all.
5. After extraction, in the WindowsNoEditor folder click the executable. Windows will probably stop it from immediately opening because it might think it's a virus, it's not, just run anyway.
